# COVID-19 Statistical Analysis
Final project report for DATA 603 - Statistical Modelling with Data at U of C, Fall 2020

By: Devin Norris, Devan Constance, Nathan Tell, and Norma-Jean Rocky

This is a project in which two open datasets from Canada's Open Data website are used to create a multivariate regression model for per capita COVID-19 cases across the country's provinces and territories. The resulting model is statistically significant and consists of total cases per 100,000 people as the dependent variable, and percentage of population that is rural, percentage of population with COPD, and percentage of population with mood disorders as the three predictor variables.
